# SlackAppHelloWorld

In this project, we are generally testing the development and use of Slack API functions, in order to automate posting of messages based off of scraped and processed data, from external sources. 
Further development will hopefully include more interactive "bot" interfaces, as well as more aesthetically pleasing / thoroughly translated data from server-side processing.
Milestones:
- Initial Slack App creation and integration ✔
- Any messaging to Slack channels ✔
- Automated messaging to Slack channels ❌
- Working out how to process data on one side of things and then push that *to* the Slack Bot ❌
- Working out how to create Slash commands to pass variables to said Slack Bot or backend interface, and return results ❌
